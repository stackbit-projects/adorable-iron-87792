I was chatting to someone recently who asked me to recommend some books they could read to skill up on helping teams get to effective delivery.  I started to build the list below, and I've leant on things like **flow**, **measurement**, **strategy**, **devops**, **human/org factors**.

To avoid overloading, I've also <img src="/images/emoji/star.png" width="50%" alt="star" /> next to the top 4 I'd recommend.


<img src="/images/emoji/books.png" width="50%" alt="books" /> **Strategy / Goal Setting**
* [Good Strategy, Bad Strategy - The difference and why it matters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy) - Although not a huge fan of the read on this, the points it makes are probably better than many other strategy books I've read
* [Measure What Matters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39286958-measure-what-matters) - it gives a really effective view of OKRs from the man who brought them to Google from Intel, and is a great read

<img src="/images/emoji/books.png" width="50%" alt="books" /> **DevOps / Flow**
* [The Phoenix Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project) <img src="/images/emoji/star.png" width="50%" alt="star" /> / [The Unicorn Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44333183-the-unicorn-project) / [The Goal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113934.The_Goal) - all great books, told as fables, around teams getting to more effective delivery leveraging a devops mindset.  They also each surface things like the theory of constraints and other key concepts.
* [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organisations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39080433-accelerate) <img src="/images/emoji/star.png" width="50%" alt="star" /> - a longitudinal look at the state of devops annual report and a solid quantifying of what factors lead to high performing delivery teams.
* [Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases Through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8686650-continuous-delivery) - very much in the mindset of the other books, but a practical look at 'how to get there'. 

<img src="/images/emoji/books.png" width="50%" alt="books" />  **Humans / Org Design / Delivery Challenges**
* [Team Topologies: Organising business and technology teams for fast flow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44135420-team-topologies) - a superb look at some patterns and challenges of building effective teams within orgs to get to delivery
* [Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67825.Peopleware) - an old book, but still has many useful points around effective software/project delivery
* [Making Work Visible: Exposing time theft to optimise work and flow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36458712-making-work-visible) :star: - a superb read on the many things that prevent teams from effectively delivering, and talks about 'time theft'.

<img src="/images/emoji/books.png" width="50%" alt="books" />  **Data**
* [Designing data-intensive applications](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44135420-team-topologies) - if you only read one book on data, I think this is great - it's perhaps less around 'effective delivery' and more around 'effectively architecting and owning', but is a useful supplemental read.

<img src="/images/emoji/books.png" width="50%" alt="books" />  **Infrastructure**
* [Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27968891-site-reliability-engineering) - again, if only one book, this looks at some of the challenges of 'it's in production, now what' and it's a useful insight into some of the things you should be thinking about with effective delivery

<img src="/images/emoji/books.png" width="50%" alt="books" />  **Software Design**
* [The Pragmatic Programmer: From journeyman to master](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer) - a very practical way of looking at software design/delivery, and probably the main book I recommend before books on design patterns/architecture etc.

<img src="/images/emoji/books.png" width="50%" alt="books" />  **Agile Mindset**
* [Sooner Safer Happier: Antipatterns and Patterns for Business Agility](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53925086-sooner-safer-happier) <img src="/images/emoji/star.png" width="50%" alt="star" />- pretty much summarises everything we've learned over the past 20 years of agile in a really accessible book.

<img src="/images/emoji/books.png" width="50%" alt="books" />  **Product Design**
* [Sprint: How to solve the big problems and test new ideas in just five days](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25814544-sprint) - design sprints can be a powerful way to test and validate ideas, so are a useful technique outside of the 'just write code' to help you understand how to rapidly get to 'build the right thing'
* [Inspired: How to create tech products customers love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35249663-inspired) - SVPG can feel a little zealous in the product space at times, though this is a great starter for 10
* [Escaping the Build Trap: How effective product management creates real value](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42611483-escaping-the-build-trap) - there's a pragmatism to this book that I really like, and it focusses on that mixed challenge of build vs. discover.
