I've laughed, cried, and felt great affinity while reading [Bren√© Brown's](https://brenebrown.com/) '[Daring Greatly](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/0241257409/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1538634796&sr=8-1&keywords=daring+greatly)'. There are so many takeaways, though it is important for us to remember that we _are_ enough, and sometimes the bravest thing we can do is show up.

Her leadership manifesto should be at the heartbeat of every organisation, not only for it's humanity, but as an indicator of just how emotionally intelligent and empathic that organisation is.

I couldn't recommend the book more highly.
