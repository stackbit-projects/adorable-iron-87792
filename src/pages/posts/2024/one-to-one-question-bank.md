  Some useful resources for conversation in a 1:1.
template: "post"
---

I've [written previously](https://terrybrown.me/posts/2019/2019-11-05-on-one-to-ones/) about what it is to have an effective 1:1, and this article won't repeat that. This article aims to provide inspiration for 1:1 questions to improve the quality and conversation you have with your team.  If you find:

* That you are rarely getting topics brought by your team member
* That 1:1s are regressing into status updates
* That 1:1s are either skipped, or cut short because there isn’t value seen in them

Then the below questions can help you bring an element more to them.

If any of the above are true, typically the best way to start with some of the below is to have a deliberate conversation in a 1:1:

> “I really want these 1:1s to be more useful to you - I love when you bring topics to talk about that are important to you, but I’ll also start to bring topics along that perhaps will encourage us to have richer conversations”

Start there, and it’ll be less problematic as you introduce the below into your 1:1 agendas. 

Most of these are focused on the manager asking the question, though many of them can be turned around to be asked by the team member.  I've also included some questions that are more 'team' focused, as these can be useful to bring to the 1:1 to discuss.


## Relationships

* What would you have liked to have done differently in a recent interaction?
  * What’s a recent situation you wish you handled differently? What would you change? 
* Who do you admire at [Company]? What things about them do you admire?
  * Is there anyone you struggle with?
* How is everything going with the people you work with/on your team?
* Have you seen someone else doing something you felt worked really well? What was it?
* What’s the most important thing you need from your team right now?
* How are you building relationships and developing “seconds” to make sure you can be away sometimes (without worrying)? 


## Elicit feedback about how I’m doing as a Manager 

* What’s one thing you need from me that will enable you to be successful?
* What do you wish we talked more about?
  * What do you not find so useful in our chats?
* What could I do differently that would make your life easier?
* What’s one gift, skill or talent you have that I’ve perhaps overlooked, under-valued, or under- utilised?
* What could I do to help you enjoy your work more?
* What’s the thing you see me doing that’s helping me best contribute to the team?
* What’s the thing I do that may be detracting from our success?
* What’s one thing I need to know about you that will improve our relationship?
* What’s one thing you need from me that will help you be more successful?
* What motivates you and how can we bring more of that to your work?
* What’s one thing you wish I did more of/less of/differently?

## The “Awkward Questions”
From [The Art of the Awkward 1:1](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/the-art-of-the-awkward-1-1-f4e1dcbd1c5c) and the [follow up post](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/awkward-1-1s-the-art-of-getting-honest-feedback-2843078b2880).  It’s never a bad thing to bring the harder questions to 1:1s, those things that are often not talked about, but may be important.

* We never seem to talk about X.  Why is that?
* What worries you most in our team?  At [Company]?
* What is impacting trust between us at the moment?
* How good is our relationship? What could we do to improve it?
* What’s going on for you at the moment that makes you feel less engaged?
* Where do you feel I'm letting you or the team down?

## To Understand Team Psychological Safety
These questions are linked to Amy Edmondson’s Psychological Safety Survey (the questions are highlighted below too) to measure psychological safety, though you can turn the questions around for 1:1s. Recommend not asking them all in a single 1:1, though they can be useful to introduce if there have been events in the team that would warrant them.

* What would happen if you made a mistake on this team?
  * Original measure: If you make a mistake on your team, is it held against you?
* When did you last disagree or want to push back on something in the team?
  * Original measure: Are you able to bring up problems and tough issues?
* How do you feel about others on the team? Who do you struggle to be your best self with?
  * Original measure: Do people on the team sometimes reject others for being different?
* What would happen if you took a risk on this team?
  * Original measure: Is it safe to take a risk?
* What does supporting each other look like in the team? What would better look like?
  * Original measure: Is it difficult to ask other team members for help?
* How would you rate your trust on the team with the person you trust the most out of 10? How would you rate it with the person you trust least?
  * Original measure: Do people on the team deliberately act to undermine your efforts?
* Which of your talents are we not leveraging effectively at the moment?
  * Original measure: Are your unique skills and talents valued and utilized?

## Goals and Challenges

* Last time we spoke you said X was a challenge for you, how is that going?
* What do you need clarity on right now?
* What’s holding you back from doing the best work you can do right now?
* What has challenged you [over a period of time]?
* What have you found difficult over the past few weeks/at the moment?
* What’s one thing (or a few) you learned this week?
* Since we last met, what are you most proud of and why?
* What has energized you in your role [over a period of time]?

## Career and growth

* Do you feel that your current responsibilities and job align with your future goals?
* What accomplishment in your career are you looking forward to this year?
* What do you want to be doing in 3 months that you can't do now?
* What do you love to do?
