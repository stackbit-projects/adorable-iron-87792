I'm a Director of Software Engineering from [Whitley Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitley_Bay), in the North East of England. I've been a remote worker since joining [GSK](https://medium.com/gsktech) in 2018, and lead a primarily remote team.

I'm an engineering leader and manager with a passion for people.  I try to create environments that allow teams to bring their best selves to work, and deliver best outcomes for the business.  If we can have a bit of fun while doing it, then it's a win.

I speak publicly on organisational culture, psychological safety, DevOps and high performing teams.  I advocate for discussion on mental health and suicide, and feel that we're better together and talking about the things that we struggle with.

My pronouns are he/him, and I try to be an active ally to the LGBT+ community.  I'm passionate about transgender issues, though not an expert.

>“I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” <cite>Maya Angelou</cite>

In my spare time, I can be found exercising (cycling, running, rowing), walking up mountains with my wife, or drinking a nice cup of tea.
