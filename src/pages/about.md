I'm a Director of Software Engineering from [Whitley Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitley_Bay), in the North East of England. I've been a remote worker since 2018 in both [GSK](https://medium.com/gsktech) and [Healx](https://healx.io), and I lead primarily remote teams.

I'm an engineering leader and manager with a passion for people.  I try to create environments that allow managers and teams to bring their best selves to work, and deliver best outcomes for the business.  I take a coaching/feedback approach with my managers, and lean on servant leadership.  If we can have a bit of fun while doing it, then it's a win.

I speak publicly on organisational culture, psychological safety, DevOps and high performing teams.  I advocate for discussion on mental health and suicide, and feel that we're better together and talking about the things that we struggle with.

If you want to read more about my approach to leadership, my [manager readme](https://managerreadme.com/readme/terry_brown) is available.

My pronouns are he/him, and I try to be an active ally to the LGBT+ community.  I'm passionate about transgender issues, though not an expert.

>“I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” <cite>Maya Angelou</cite>

In my spare time, I can be found exercising (cycling, running, rowing), walking up mountains with my wife, or drinking a nice cup of tea.
